This zip file contains all pwms from the datasets hosted by the
UniPROBE Database.  The sub-folders are named for the journal and year
of publication; for complete reference details please visit
http://www.uniprobe.org).

Generally, the file names indicate the protein name, but for some
publications, the file names indicate the protein name, the four digit
clone identifier, and in some cases, also the single digit shipment
identifier used internally by the database.

Files with _RC suffix are reverse complement pwms.  Files with
_secondary suffix are secondary motifs, where available (and _primary
is the primary motif).
