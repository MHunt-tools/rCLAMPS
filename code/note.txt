NOTE:  This 'result.pickle' file contains the same 'final_model' as
'../results/cisbp-chuAll/structFixed1_grpHoldout_multinomial_ORACLEFalseChain100Iter15scaled50.pickle'
which was used to generate the reported results in the article. It was generated after updating the 
code to generalize for multidomain proteins (e.g., the C2H2-ZFs) to test/ensure that the update
did not cause bugs or unforseen changes to the results reported.
